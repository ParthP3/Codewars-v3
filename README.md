# CodeWars-v3 : The Actual War

The game-engine code for the CodeWars-v3 reside in this repository.


The theme for this year's iteration of CodeWars is based on the medieval age at the time of Crusaders. 

# Commodities 

We shall divide the commodities into two sections broadly: Raw and Derived

## Raw Commodities 

It includes:

1. Wood
2. Stone
3. Gold
4. Food
5. Iron

## Derived Commodities

1. Defense Equipments
2. Attack Equipments
3. Farming

# Population 

Food being a raw commodity plays a major role in the population of the empire. 
Each person in the population consumes a unit of food. 
If there is a surplus amount of food, more population will join in the empire else it dies in the case when population is more than the food reserve. 

# Initial Situation

Initially each player would be awarded with some fixed amount of gold which can be traded for other raw commodities. Every derived commodity listed above can be built using a combination of the raw commodities. 
The amount of raw commodities spent in building the derived commodities would decide the <b>quality</b> of it. 

# Education

There would be specialised types of education:

1. Engineer education : This would mainly decide the build quality of the defense and attack equipments. 
2. Farmer education : This would improve the rate at which the food is produced. 
3. Troop education : This would improve the overall strength of your army which would then be matched against the army equipments of the enemy to decide who wins. 
4. Spy education: The empire can be trained to have spies who can be deployed anywhere in the play arena and thus can easily disclose the location of enemy empire and the troops where they are deployed. 
5. Miner education : Improves the mining capacity of the miners to mine gold, chop wood, carve stones and extract iron.

Note: Educating the population would be globally effective, one can't decide an exclusive number from the population that can be trained for a specific education.
