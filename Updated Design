Functions to be coded by players:

ResouceAllocator():
  Each player is alloacted 100 food points, 100 raw materials and 1 10x10 grid of land
  
  Initially the player must allocate these resources to different things
  Troop - 1 food point
  Miner - 1 food point
  Farmer - 1 food point
  Engineer - 2 food point
  Spy - 2 food point
  
  Note that troops die in combat and their number will grow automatically depending on food production in the future
  Other specializations don't die in combat and their numbers don't grow automatically. They can only be increased
  in the future by capturing other clans.
  
  Initial defence = x raw materials
  Initial Offence = 100-x raw materials
  //x has to be decided by the user
  
  Now the rate of generation will be:
    FoodGeneratadPerSecond = f ( land, farmers )
    RawMaterialsPerSecond = f ( land, miners )
    AttackCapabilitesCreatedPerSecond = f ( engineers , raw materials ) * fraction
    DefenceCapabilitiesCreatedPerSecond = f ( engineers , raw materials ) * (1-fraction)
    The fraction has to be decided by user

DefenceStrategy():
 Rules:
  Each area of land is either green, red or yellow
  In any area of land if you choose to deploy more troops than the enemy, then you always win. But those troops then have
  to stay in the same area till end of war. (They cannot be reused)
  
  As your defence capabilites increase, you have to startegically make more areas red or yellow
  1 red = 2 defence points
  1 yellow = 1 defence point
  
  or you can use defence points to capture spies and send them back (you cannot kill them)
  1 spy capture = 5 defence points
  
  or you can use defence points to increase your kingdom morale (percentage of land that has to be captured for you
  to surrender)
  
AttackStrategy():
  Every second you have to Choose which kingdom to attack or to not attack at all
  
  Once you have started the attack, you have to decide based on your spy data and logic
  Where to place your troops
  Where to deploy your attackcapabilites
  
  (attackcapabilites can be something like a bomb, which will destroy the defence equipment and make the area
  from red/yellow to green)
  
  You also need to decide everysecond, whether to continue the attack or abort
  If you abort:
    All your troops which you used in war which are dead are left to rot, and the ones alive come back.
    You do not gain any terriroty
  If you win:
    Either by enemy troops falling below a certain limit
    or Capturing a certain percentage of the enemy area
    All the leftover enemy troops, engineers, food, land etc become yours

SpyDeployer():
  Create a function which deploys spies effectively to send you data of relevant kingdoms.
